# Guide to Editing Docs

Hello! As you may be able to notice, this docs site is completely open source and free to edit on GitHub. You can see the GitHub page for this site at [https://github.com/space-wizards/docs](https://github.com/space-wizards/docs).

There are a couple things to keep in mind when contributing. While we disallow web-edit PRs (those made exclusively on GitHub) on the main Space Station 14 & Robust Toolbox repos, that is not the case here. **Web-editing is encouraged** to make editing documentation as painless as possible.

If you want to get an idea of what features are at your disposal when writing documentation, go to our [Docs Example Page](./docs-example-page.md).

To start a basic edit of a page, simply follow these steps:

1. Create an accout on GitHub, or log in if you already have one.

2. Fork the [space-wizards/docs](https://github.com/space-wizards/docs) repo on GitHub.

5. Make your changes, then commit & create a pull request! We'll handle the rest.

More in-depth information for contributors, like how to test locally & port pages from our old docs site, is available on our [README](https://github.com/space-wizards/docs/blob/master/README.md) for the GitHub docs site.
