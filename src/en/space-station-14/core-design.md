# Core Game Design
This document contains the Core Game Design Principles of SS14 and its Gameplay Pillars.
These principles and pillars should be used to inform the design of any new designs or large balance changes. 

Questions around Core Game Design should be directed towards the Design Committee Group on the Official SS14 Discord (Prefered) or if you do not use Discord by making a thread on the SS14 Forums.

### Caveats
- This document is a living document and will change overtime as the design of SS14 evolves.
- These principles and pillars are one interpretation of what SS14 should be and only reflects the direction of Wizden (upstream) LRP and MRP servers.
- Forks and other communities may have different ideas and directions which they want to take the game, which is fine and something we want to encourage!
- Forks can use these principles as a base or create their own, this is primarily intended to serve as a direction for upstream SS14 development.


## Placeholder Page, this doc is actively under development
This document will be filled out as core design elements are decided on by the Design Committe.
